Thanks for choosing to play and participate in the official Geek NZ Geek Wars! There's a couple of things you should know before you go into it, including how to score points for your clan, and geek etiquette.

## Capturing the other clan's treasure

To capture the enemy's treasure, firstly you must be signed in to your clan. You can do this at your clan's hall. At their hall there may be traps or parkour to do in order to obtain their treasure, so be careful! Right click it with an empty hand to pick it up, and return it to your clan's treasure to score a point.

Easy, right? We thought so too. That's why while you're carrying treasure, you're significantly nerfed:
- You cannot use rockets with elytras, gliding only.
- Enderpearls don't work
- Nether portals don't work
- Carpet teleportation doesn't work

Yes that's right, the only way to carry the enemies treasure from their clan hall to yours is by _walking._ Doesn't sound so easy now, right? You'll need to work together with your team to be protected and score for your clan.

Once you capture the enemies treasure, it is sent back to their clan hall and deactivated, it will only activate once a day in the morning. This means you can only capture their treasure daily.

## Preventing the other clan from capturing your treasure

So what can you do to prevent the other clan from capturing your treasure? Options include keeping the location of your clan hall a tight keep secret, concealing it, and even booby-trapping the hall. Think Indiana Jones style!

If you manage to kill the carrier of your treasure, it will drop on the ground, and right-clicking it will send it back to your base.

## Getting kills

The other aspect of the Geek Wars is killing. If **and only if an enemy player is signed in to their clan** and you are signed in to yours, you can kill them for an extra point for your clan. Being signed in essentially puts a target on your back, so be careful!
