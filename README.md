## Introduction

Geek Wars is mostly a Capture The Flag (CTF) like event between two clans, the Milk Drinkers and the Wool Weavers. Internally, and in commands, these are referred to as `cows` and `sheep`. Clan members are able to steal the opposite clan's treasure from their clan hall and bring it back to theirs for points. You can only do this once per day to prevent farming. But good luck finding the clan halls! They're hidden and may even be booby-trapped. The only way to identify a clan hall's location is the *clan tower* on it that's identical for both clans.

The other aspect of Geek Wars is the PVP. Players can kill opposite clan members *Only if they are signed in to their clan.* If they are signed out PVP is prohibited, so those not wishing to participate in the PVP can opt out of it. If you choose to participate however, check over your shoulders once in a while because you could get killed anywhere, anytime!

At the end of the event, the clan with the most treasure captures and kills will win. Signs at spawn will automatically update with the latest tally of kills and captures for each clan, so make sure to help your clan win!
