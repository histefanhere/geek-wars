# COW vs SHEEP GUILD WAR

## Guilds
- Two guilds, *Milk Drinkers* (MD) and *Sheep Clan* (SC)
- Players can "sign in" and "sign out" of the guild
  - honour system so once you've signed into one you can't sign into the other, or plugin?
- Sign in and out at guild halls
- Signed in players have a *guild tag* in chat to show them being signed in


## Combat
- If player has a guild tag they can be *killed on sight*
- PVP can happen anywhere except main server areas
- Count how many player kills with guild tag
- Most kills at end of map is superior
- **Items must be returned**
- **Only considered a legal kill if they have guild tag on**


## Guild Halls
- Each guild has a *guild hall* (within 5k of spawn)
- Guilds can build their own guild halls
  - APART from *guild towers* that's the same for both guilds to show where it is
- Keep the locations secret from the other guild


## Guild Treasure
- There is *treasure* to protect at guild halls (probs cow or sheep head)
- Acts like CTF. Find the opposing treasure, bring to your own guild hall for a point to your guild
- Every 24 hours the treasure respawns
